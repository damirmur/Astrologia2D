Actually, I never liked how the data is stored in Zet, and working with data is inconvenient. Take the same family analysis. Well, the data in one folder is good, then skip the history, and if a bunch of events for the whole family or team (100-500 people) are checked, then how - open it here, close it here and so a thousand times. Well, yes, in Zet, building graphs based on astroformulas is not a masterpiece - at a rudimentary level.

One of the properties of the human mind is to simplify everything, to find some Grail (or the quantum equation of everything) - and all problems are solved. In astrology, you see, someone is trying to reduce the number of the horoscope to someone, someone is looking for a synthetic sign or a planet. The object must be sought, at least three-dimensional, with 10 nested space-time continums, spaces of worlds. Like, a Christmas tree, where on top of the star is lit - the sun. Probably still grouped by chakras, 4-7 worlds.
